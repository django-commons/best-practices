## Architecture

The django-commons-playground is a collection of utility functions with a
playground theme. The purpose is to serve as an example to inbound repositories.
Because of that the documentation, pre-commit configuration and GitHub actions
are the most important aspects of the project. The code itself is secondary.

## Running the tests

```shell
python3 -m unittest
```

Nothing special here!

## Releasing

The repo is configured to [automatically release to PyPI](https://github.com/django-commons/django-commons-playground/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)
when a new tag is pushed to GitHub. This makes use of [PyPI's trusted publishers](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/).

### Manual releases

In the case a manual release is necessary, you'll need to use [Twine](https://github.com/pypa/twine) and [Build](https://github.com/pypa/build).

```shell
# Install packaging dependencies
python3 -m pip install -U twine build
# Build the project
python3 -m build
# Release to test PyPI
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
# Release to PyPI
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```
